This volume is a rework of a program I wrote as the final project for Code In Place, a Stanford University online Python programming primer.
The original program interface was built in Python, but after attempting to meld the Python codebase with web tools and PyScript in order
to host the program somewhere public, it became apparent that the simpler, more elegant method of deploying this program would be by utilizing
Javascript as the main code base for the API call. This program reflects that.
